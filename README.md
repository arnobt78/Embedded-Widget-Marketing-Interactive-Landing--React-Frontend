## Widget Integration Guide

You can embed the feedback widget into any HTML page (including this project) with just a few lines:

```html
<!-- Load React and ReactDOM UMD builds for the widget -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<!-- Include the widget script from your Vercel deployment -->
<script src="https://embedded-feedback.vercel.app/widget.umd.js"></script>
<my-widget
  api-base="https://embedded-feedback.vercel.app/api/feedback"
></my-widget>
```

- The `api-base` attribute should point to your deployed Next.js API endpoint.
- The widget will automatically inject its styles and handle feedback submission.

**To integrate into your own project:**

1. Deploy the widget project to Vercel.
2. Copy the script and `<my-widget>` tag above into your HTML.
3. Optionally, style or position the widget as needed.
